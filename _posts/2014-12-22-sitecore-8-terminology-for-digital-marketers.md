If you&#8217;re a marketer and your website is powered by Sitecore, at some point you&#8217;ll interact directly or indirectly with the platform itself. This may be as a content editor or copy writer. With that experience you&#8217;ll know Sitecore is full of &#8220;new&#8221; terms even if you&#8217;ve worked with other CMS systems before such as WordPress. And whether it&#8217;s Content Editor, Sublayout, Page Editor, Ribbon or Standard Values, we can all agree that it&#8217;s a little tricky to remember and understand everything that&#8217;s going on with the terminology of Sitecore.

With the release of Sitecore 8, new (improved?) terminology is here and dare I say it sounds like they&#8217;re here to stay. But thankfully, you&#8217;ve got me, and I&#8217;ve got Sitecore 8 terminology for digital marketers. So lets take a look at some of the more basic Sitecore terminology that any and all digital marketers should know:

These are just some of the more important terms you&#8217;ll come across working with Sitecore as a marketer. And although Sitecore 8 is feature rich as a digital marketing platform, if you don&#8217;t know the basic terms of the system you&#8217;ll be doing yourself a great disservice.
