There&#8217;s little doubt Sitecore needs more developers blogging and writing great informative articles about their products, development and just general opinions. But that&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t some amazing and helpful bloggers out there already. So with that said, this is my list of the best Sitecore resources for beginners in 2014.

## <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/Learn/Blogs/Technical-Blogs/John-West-Sitecore-Blog.aspx" title="John West" target="_blank">John West&#8217;s Blog</a>

CTO of Sitecore USA, John&#8217;s technical blog covers all sorts of areas and where better to get your information than directly from the source.

A college of mine at <a href="http://www.nonlinearcreations.com/" title="nonlinear creations" target="_blank">nonlinear creations</a> Jason is a multi facetted Solution Architect and Sitecore MVP. His blog mainly covers of Sitecore architecture and continuos development & deployment.

Based on the article entry dates some of the site&#8217;s material is a bit old (particularly the beginners/intro stuff). However, the content itself is still great for getting a good overview of the product and understanding what Sitecore is and how to get started. Plus some of the more recent material is quite good.

Okay, I might be a bit bias here, but with multiple Sitecore MVPs, developers and solution architects how can you ignore any blog post or article by nonlinear digital???

## <a href="https://www.hhogdev.com/blog.aspx" title="HedgeHog" target="_blank">HedgeHog</a>

If you&#8217;re using Sitecore, you should be using TDS for source control. That being said, HedgeHog Development has some nice articles about Sitecore deployment using their products. A good read during your free time.
