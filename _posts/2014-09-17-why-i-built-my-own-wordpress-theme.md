Deciding to write a WordPress theme seems like a pretty straight forward decision, so answering &#8220;why I built my own WordPress theme&#8221; would seem obvious, but this is actually a more complicated question than it sounds. I&#8217;ve worked with WordPress in one way or another since around 2006. During this time I&#8217;ve been a freelancer (and full-time) developer working with many technologies &#8211; ActionScript was my first website gig&#8230;an all Flash website, do those even exist anymore??? 

For the past 8 years the most I&#8217;ve worked with WordPress was as an admin, i.e. manual installations, updating themes, updating/installing plugins and backing stuff up. Given my diverse background (mainly C# and PHP) I also did a little theme tweaking and plugin bug fixing.

Through all of this I never really thought to become a &#8220;WordPress developer&#8221;. Now I have. Along with my career at <a href="http://www.nonlinearcreations.com/" title="nonlinear creations" target="_blank">nonlinear</a> as a Sitecore solution architect, I believe getting a deeper dive into WordPress would be the perfect fit. <a href="http://www.sitecore.net/" title="Sitecore" target="_blank">Sitecore</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, are both great CMS platforms mostly targeting different user groups. Sitecore is a premium .NET Enterprise CMS targeting marketers and the user experience while WordPress, besides all the rightfully deserved hype over the past decade, I actually ENJOY working with it and learning about it but if you can believe it, that&#8217;s only the first answer to the question of why I wrote my own WordPress theme.

**Because I can (try)**  
What&#8217;s a WordPress developer if you can&#8217;t hack your way through a basic theme from scratch? Theme development should be the first test any developer goes through. It&#8217;s a great experience from a beginner&#8217;s perspective and you&#8217;re forced to learn the basics of WordPress. Understanding the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy" title="Template Hierarchy" target="_blank">template hierarchy</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/" title="WordPress reference" target="_blank">functions and hooks</a> makes you a better WordPress developer. Period. And btw, you need to check out this great interactive <a href="http://wphierarchy.com/" title="WP Hierarchy" target="_blank">Template Hierarchy </a>diagram.

**Taste.**  
If you&#8217;re a previous reader of mine you&#8217;ll know I had a pretty decent theme before. It wasn&#8217;t too flashy or fancy. This one is even less so but that&#8217;s exactly what I wanted. I&#8217;ve looked at a ton of themes, they all look great, but for my needs and personal taste, I needed to tone it down a bit a go minimal. I&#8217;m happy to report there are quite a few awesome minimalist type themes out there. However, I found none that I loved completely. My choice? Live with what I got or make my own&#8230;

**Only the beginning.**  
I want this theme to be a mixture of all things I love about existing minimalist themes, some are completely stripped of functionality except those required by WordPress itself, while others add some of the bells and whistles of the fancier, trendier themes. I&#8217;ve started off with the <a href="http://mnmlist.com/" title="mnmlist" target="_blank">mnmlist</a> theme as my starter theme, but once I&#8217;m satisfied, I&#8217;ll update to <a href="http://underscores.me/" title="Underscores" target="_blank">Underscores</a> (_s) and then finally, move everything over to <a href="http://roots.io/" title="Roots.io" target="_blank">Roots.io</a> &#8211; learning as I go along, everything from hacking someone else&#8217;s theme (mnmlist) to Underscores (the team from WordPress) to smooth workflow and frameworks (Grunt, Bower and Bootstrap with Roots).

At the end of this journey I&#8217;m hoping to have an awesome minimalist theme, some key functionality, and an Options page to tweak some settings. I&#8217;ll keep you updated when it&#8217;s available for download from WordPress.

What do you think is the best minimalist WordPress theme out there to date?
