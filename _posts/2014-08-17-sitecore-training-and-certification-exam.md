I recently took the Sitecore training and certification exam for Sitecore CEP 7 and I wanted to share my experiences with everyone else like me out there who didn&#8217;t know what to expect and only found a few sites out in the wild to help out. Hopefully, this will add to the knowledge base and the growing number of Sitecore developers out there.

## Verdict/Summary

If you want to learn a .NET CMS platform, Sitecore should be on the top of your list. And you could definitely pick up books, go online and read blogs like mine or the <a title="Sitecore blog" href="http://www.sitecore.net/Learn/Blogs/Technical-Blogs.aspx" target="_blank">Sitecore official blog</a> site but in the end probably the best introduction to Sitecore is from formal training.  For me, it was <a title="Sitecore Training" href="http://www.sitecore.net/Services-and-Support/Training/Developer-trainings/WND-Sitecore-Website-Development-for-NET-Developers.aspx" target="_blank">Sitecore CEP/XP 7.0 .NET Web Developer</a>.

## Where I started from

Let me start off with a little about myself and experience prior to starting the Sitecore training. I have a Software Engineering degree with about 10 years of working experience in the IT industry. I&#8217;d be the first to say I&#8217;m no expert but much more of a jack of all trades (and master of none)&#8230;Which is something I&#8217;ve learned to live with and have come to realization that it&#8217;s a great asset to have. Not many developers have experience in C#, PHP, Python, T-SQL, SSRS, HTML, CSS and JQuery &#8211; plus, no one company uses any one technology.

## Why get certified

This question is pretty simple. I recently got a great new gig at <a title="nonlinear creations" href="http://www.nonlinearcreations.com/" target="_blank">nonlinear creations</a> and being a top partner of Sitecore they have a number of certified developers and Sitecore MVPs. Once I was hired the first thing on my list was becoming certified. There are a number of people and websites that discuss the pros and cons of certification, but for me having one (no matter what the technology) is better than not having one. And although demand still outstrips supply &#8211; at least in Toronto &#8211; the IT industry is packed full of us, so having any edge above the competition is always a good thing in my books.

## New York, New York

My training facility was in the financial district of NYC. The NYC facility was pretty standard when it comes to training facilities. The trainer was <a title="Jim DeMarco" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimdemarco3" target="_blank">Jim DeMarco</a>, he was a great trainer on all fronts &#8211; knowledgeable, clarity, kept things moving along, helpful etc. To my pleasant surprise the training grounds also had some pretty delicious food, okay maybe not delicious, but it decent. Free breakfast, pop drinks, chips and cookies. What more can you ask for?

## The training

Not in hindsight, I think the training was good and covered a lot of areas. I left the course knowing how to install Sitecore, configure items, create layouts, deploy the website and debug. In hindsight, none of it was enough for real world situations. BUT it was an excellent introduction to the product and how it can be used. Some of the topics included, Sitecore desktop and page editor, Sitecore Rocks&#8230;..Sitecore Rocks is a great product but the problem with it for me is not being able to do everything in the one interface while in Sitecore desktop, although not the greatest, it&#8217;s more efficient in some cases given that everything can be achieved in one area.

## Exam Time!

Study. There&#8217;s not much to it&#8230;and pay attention when actually in class because there are a few &#8220;trick&#8221; questions.  
The questions are supposed to be randomly generated, by which I mean, you may not get the same question as others in your class. Some questions were similar to &#8220;Which method would you call to get the context db&#8221;, while others where situational problems and you had to find the best suited answer.

Again, it&#8217;s multiple choice and you have plenty of time, so I truly believe if you fail the exam it&#8217;s either because of a) You pissed around during class and didn&#8217;t pay attention or b) You have no technical background and couldn&#8217;t grasp the  
concepts, in which case you shouldn&#8217;t have taken this particular course to begin with.

I finished the exam in about 45mins (40 questions) with a 90% score. Awesome! Kindof, now it&#8217;s time for real world work. I&#8217;ll keep you updated on how things go and how different/lacking the certification is in comparison.

Are you certified? Do you plan to get certified?
