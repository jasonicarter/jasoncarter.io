Your WordPress site is up and running but you still think something&#8217;s missing. Well, you&#8217;re right! For those who don&#8217;t know, <a title="WordPress plugins" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">WordPress plugins</a> add extra functionality to your blog and is probably the number one feature that makes WordPress so amazing. But with over 32k plugins as of August 2014, which ones are the best? But more importantly, which ones are the Top 5 WordPress Plugins for beginners?

<!--more-->

Let&#8217;s check out MY list&#8230;I personally use each plugin listed below and if that ever changes I&#8217;ll let you know.

## 1. WordPress SEO by Yoast

It&#8217;s all about SEO. And SEO is all about google (and other) search engine ranking, accessibility and other things. Now I&#8217;ll be the first to say I know very little about this brave new world of SEO. But there&#8217;s one thing I do know, <a title="Yoast" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> is the most popular WordPress SEO plugin out there, and from personal use I can say it does work and it&#8217;s pretty ease to figure out how to do get things setup. Plus it helps you write better content, which is always welcomed.

## 2. Minimal Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode

Or really just any Coming Soon/Maintenance page plugin. However, the <a title="Maintenance Mode" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/minimal-coming-soon-maintenance-mode/" target="_blank">Minimal Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode</a> plugin is pretty damn sweet. I like the minimal look and feel, you can control who exactly see&#8217;s the maintenance page (authors, editors, everyone, etc). You can also change background colors, layout and integrate it with MailChimp to keep track of readers interested in knowing when your doors will open.

## 3. Google Analytics Dashboard for WP

Whether a simple blog or a blog with 100k subscribers, if you want to improve your site and your user&#8217;s experience, having analytics will help you. I personally use <a title="Google Analytics Dashboard" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/" target="_blank">Google analytics Dashboard for WP</a> and haven&#8217;t looked back since. Some of the great features are:

  * Add a dashboard widget to view your analytics from Google
  * Exclude WordPress users such as administrators, editors, etc.
  * Track download links
  * Provide analytics to your front end website via widget

## 4. Disqus Comment System

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-88" src="http://jasoncarter.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/disqus_screenshot-300x212.png" alt="disqus screen shot" width="300" height="212" />When creating your blog you&#8217;ll notice that WordPress already has a pretty decent comment system. So I&#8217;m guessing your first question would be why do I need another one, I had the same question! The fact is, you may not need anything more but your readers (and you) will soon realize the bonus&#8217; of having more advanced features.

Enters Disqus (pronouced &#8216;discus&#8217;). Disqus is probably the most well known blogging comment system out there. Basically, instead of forcing your user to provide personal information and sign in just to leave a comment, Disqus allows the user to create a profile once and use that same profile all over the internet (where ever Disqus plugin/api is used). But more than that, your readers can user their own social network profile, i.e. facebook or twitter to login and leave comments.

The more hurdles you remove from your reader to leave a comment, the more likely they will do so. Disqus is a very social user engagement platform/plugin, other users are able to view profiles and see comments you&#8217;ve made on other websites.

## 5. Shareaholic

The one reason we all write, or think about writing, a blog is in order to share our thoughts with others whether it be advice, a tip, opinion or our experience. And the best way to share our blog posts is via a social media plugin.

<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/shareaholic/" target="_blank">Shareaholic</a> is one of the most popular social sharing plugins out there for WordPress. Along with a vast number of sites to share content with, from Twitter and Tumblr to Amazon Wish List and back again to LinkedIn, plus everything in between. You also get a number of options such for icons, layout and advanced settings. Add related content into the mix which works with SEO plugins such as WordPress SEO by Yoast and you&#8217;ve got yourself one powerful plugin and any beginner blogger must have.
