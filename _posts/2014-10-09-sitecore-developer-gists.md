Working as a Sitecore developer you come across interesting, cool, ah ha and doh! moments all the time. And it&#8217;s because of this that I&#8217;ve decided to keep a list of my Sitecore developer gists and slap them online. 

I&#8217;ll keep this post updated with the most interesting ones and hopefully you&#8217;ll find them as useful as I did. If you have a comment/question feel free to leave a note below&#8230;

## Is my Sitecore placeholder empty?

This really shouldn&#8217;t have taken me so long to figure out but after overthinking and googling it to no prevail I stumbled into two easy answers with the help of my brain and Stack Overflow.



## Restrict Insert Option items of the same template ID

Here we&#8217;ll be creating an Insert Rule to only add the option if the item doesn&#8217;t already exist as a child of the selected item.
