So you want to start a WordPress blog but you don&#8217;t know where to begin. Well, you&#8217;re in luck! Upon starting this blog I decided to document my little journey in the hopes of keeping a personal record but also giving back and helping out those going through the same thing.

<!--more-->

This isn&#8217;t my first blog but my previous ones were a little short lived as both were specific to my <a title="WordsPlus" href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/24752875/?lang=en&countrycode=CA" target="_blank">Blackberry app development</a>, and with the new direction Blackberry has been taking lately, both sites had premature endings. So here we are again, third times the charm, right? In any case, I&#8217;ve been there, done that so sit back relax and count to 5.

## 1. A Blog? Yes!

The very first step is to decide that you actually want to write a blog AND that you want to keep writing on your blog. It can be quite a commitment to maintain and continually improve the blog but that shouldn&#8217;t stop you from at least trying.

## 2. What you talkin&#8217; bout, Willis?



You need a topic(s) to talk about and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed how many other sites tell you &#8220;be unique&#8221; or &#8220;be an expert or passionate&#8221; in a particular subject/topic. This is all true, but hey, who cares. You have pretty much a zero barrier of entry so I say go for it. Pick any topic you like or would like to blog about and just start writing. As you find more things to discuss with your readers you&#8217;ll get great feedback from them but more importantly, you&#8217;ll continue writing, reading and learning.

## 3. What did you call me?!?!

Pick and buy a domain name, a great, amazing, ever lasting name for your site. There are a ton of ways to do this, based on your personality, your name, your site&#8217;s topics or it could just be random (although I don&#8217;t recommend it). I won&#8217;t go through all of the details here but remember whatever you pick make sure you like it. Changing your site&#8217;s name, moving content and dealing with SEO ranking, etc can be a huge pain in the neck.

You can find a great list of sites to help you in your name search from this link at <a title="Domain name tools" href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/17/domain-name-research-tools/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>. I tried a few of them, although to be honest, none of them really helped that much so I made up &#8220;Json Carter&#8221; all by myself.

## 4. DIY Hosting or handover control

<img class="alignleft wp-image-37 size-medium" src="http://jasoncarter.io/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/network_cable-300x213.jpg" alt="Network cable" width="300" height="213" />At this step you have more options, self-host or have someone do it for you. Personally, I think the term &#8220;self-host&#8221; is a bit misleading because very few of us actually host their own servers at home (now that&#8217;s real self-hosting!). But nonetheless, a perfect example is hosting your site on wordpress.com, blogspot or tumblr verses using a hosting site such as <a title="A Small Orange" href="http://www.asmallorange.com/?a_aid=JSONCARTER" target="_blank">A Small Orange</a> (affiliate link).

The major difference is control. You have more control over things when you self-host but do you WANT that control? If you&#8217;re not technically inclined and don&#8217;t want to be or if you don&#8217;t have any geeky friends hanging around, then having someone do it for you like <a title="Free hosting by WordPress" href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a> (not .org) is probably best. For me, I use A Small Orange (affiliate link) to host my blog. They have the best rates, a beautifully designed website and a very user friendly backend site management area. Here&#8217;s a review of A Small Orange from <a title="ASO Review" href="https://www.besthostnews.com/asmallorange-review" target="_blank">BestHostNews.com</a>

## 5. Get WordPress

Sure, there are a lot of other blogging software/platforms that you can use but WordPress is the most well-known and most (end) user friendly one I&#8217;ve seen. To get WordPress installed, you have 2 more choices, a) do it yourself which is pretty easy or b) use your hosting site to do it for you via scriptaculous . I prefer doing it myself, again, more control.

Go to this download link and get <a title="Download WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Setup an FTP account on your host and get a FTP client. I like and use FileZilla. After that, unzip the WordPress file, log into your host via FTP and upload the WordPress folder with all contents to the **main/root folder**. I personally like to keep all of my WordPress files in its own folder but still have my site run by WordPress. The main difference here is **www.example.com** vs **www.example.com/blog**. Because we&#8217;re talking about creating a blog site, I highly recommend installing WordPress at your site&#8217;s root but in a separate folder &#8211; take a look at these <a title="Give WordPress its own directory" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory" target="_blank">instructions</a> from WordPress on how to do this. This way things are MUCH cleaner and organized.

## 5. START!

Yup. You&#8217;re done. Kindof. WordPress has a famous 5-minute installation process so if you follow the links above and you&#8217;re an absolute beginner, it shouldn&#8217;t take you any longer than 10 minutes to get setup.

There are a ton of a other things you need to do in order to be a &#8220;good&#8221; and lasting blogger but that&#8217;s a whole other blog post. Being a better writer, getting comments, ranking, etc are all things that take time. And we haven&#8217;t even brushed on plugins, themes, security, comments, SEO, etc. but it&#8217;s a marathon, not a sprint and every one needs to start somewhere.

Go write something!
