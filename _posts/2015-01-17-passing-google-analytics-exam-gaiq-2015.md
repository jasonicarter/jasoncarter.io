As I type, I&#8217;m literally still coming off my high from passing the Google Analytics exam GAIQ 2015, a few hours ago. But instead of going out partying and celebrating my new found GA knowledge I decided to come here and write it all down for you while it&#8217;s still fresh.

Now you might be wondering why you should care about my glorious GAIQ status (Google Analytics Individual Qualification), particularly when there&#8217;s so many other blogs out there &#8220;teaching&#8221; you how to pass the exam in two days or 5 easy steps, etc. Well, I too was drawn in by these posts and some were very useful but one major issue was that they are mostly all **OLD** posts. The GAIQ exam has been recently updated, I think as of December 2014 or January 2015. So here I am with a few things to note if you&#8217;re curious about passing the Google Analytics exam GAIQ 2015.

Let&#8217;s begin like every other GA blog post and check out my, umm, easy-5-steps-two-days-study to GAIQ glory&#8230;(disclaimer: you need to do more than 5 steps)

## Exam Taking Details

  * You have 90 minutes
  * 70 multiple choice questions
  * Require over 80% to pass
  * Certification is valid for 18 months
  * **NO** pausing
  * **NO** skipping questions
  * And **NO** returning to past questions
  * But now it&#8217;s also completely free to take
  * I&#8217;ve read that if you fail you have to wait **7 days** before taking it again

Almost all other articles I&#8217;ve read mentioned how your strategy should be: pause and/or mark questions, do some research, then come back to answer the questions later. I believe back then you could pause up to three (3) times. No longer.

Some articles also say Google has made the questions harder i.e the questions are more about application of the knowledge than pure definition of terms, this I agree with. Although I have no prior knowledge to compare it with as I&#8217;ve only taken the exam once.

## How to Pass on Your First Try

**Study**. Next question? Okay, fine. Here&#8217;s what I did.

  1. Create a <a title="Google Partners" href="http://google.ca/partners" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Partner</a> account &#8211; this is where they house the certifications now
  2. Watch, at least twice, each of the following: <a title="Google Analytics" href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course01" target="_blank">Digital Analytics Fundamentals</a>, <a title="Platform Principles" href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course02" target="_blank">Google Analytics Platform Principles</a>, <a title="Ecommerce Analytics" href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course03" target="_blank">Ecommerce Analytics</a> and <a title="Mobile Analytics" href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course04" target="_blank">Mobile App Analytics Fundamentals</a>
  3. Watch all of the above one last time and take notes (don&#8217;t over do it on the note taking)
  4. Glance over this great cheat sheet by <a title="Blast GAIQ Cheat Sheet" href="http://www.blastam.com/resources/Blast-Google-Analytics-Reference-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Blast Analytics and Marketing</a>
  5. Take the exam

**WAIT!** Don&#8217;t take the exam just let. The areas of study are broad so you probably want to know what to concentrate on and &#8220;how&#8221; to take it. Read up on my next topic below&#8230;

## How to Take the Exam

Everyone has their own way of studying and prepping for exams, so this particular way was mine. I passed on the first try and with about a week of on and off studying. The exam isn&#8217;t ridiculously hard but you do need to know what you&#8217;re talking about &#8211; do what you will with that information.

Remember, this is an open book exam so I had a different browser open with a few tabs handy for looking things up. Don&#8217;t waste all of your time researching answer. **Study**. My list of tabs comprised of:

1. **<a title="Blast Cheat Sheet" href="http://www.blastam.com/resources/Blast-Google-Analytics-Reference-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Blast Cheat Sheet</a>**  
2. **<a title="URL builder" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en" target="_blank">URL Campaign Builder</a>**  
3. **<a title="Reg Ex Tool" href="http://www.regexr.com" target="_blank">Regular Expression Tool</a>**  
4. **<a title="Analytics Help Centre" href="https://support.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics Help Centre</a>**  
5. **<a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google Search</a>**  
6. **My own Google Analytics account page**

I&#8217;m pretty sure exam questions are pulled from a pool so the number of topic areas in mine will be different than yours but my exam covered &#8211; **Campaigns**, **intelligence alerts**, **Tag Manager**, **Filters + Views** **Mobile**, a few definition questions and a lot of **application of knowledge**. I used mostly <a title="Analytics Help Centre" href="https://support.google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics Help Centre</a> and my own GA account but to be honest, I answered over half of the questions without researching them &#8211; I studied, remember?

I suggest you read and watch everything above and brush up on your weak spots. After all, it&#8217;s not about passing just for the sake of it but to actually learn something.

## Real Life Google Analytics Exam Questions

If you studied, you&#8217;ll be able to relax throughout the exam and leisurely take screen shots of questions to post on your yet-to-be-created blog post about passing the exam (I&#8217;m still super pumped can you tell?). The type and range of questions you may get are in the gallery below and my &#8220;conclusion&#8221; is below that, so scroll all the way down. Enjoy! (click to enlarge)

## Conclusion

Passing the Google Analytics (GAIQ) exam was a great feeling, particularly on the first try, but the knowledge I gained from learning more about Google Analytics is awesome. I honestly didn&#8217;t know you could do so much with GA or how much data you could collect. Google Tag Manager, Adwords, Webmaster Tools, external data can all be pulled in and reported on in one place with great reporting and filtering ability.

I finished the exam in about an hour. It would have been great to go over my questions to review and update but in the end, it is indeed an open book exam &#8211; just how easy do you want it to be? Plus, it needs credibility. Making the changes Google has, such as no pausing or marking questions for later, in my opinion was a great move. **You&#8217;ll feel smarter because of it and your clients will be happier due to it.**
