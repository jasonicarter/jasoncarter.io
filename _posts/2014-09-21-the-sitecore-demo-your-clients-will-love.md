As a Sitecore developer, I work fairly close with clients on an ongoing basis, whether it&#8217;s clarifying a requirement or understanding an issue in order to fix it. Working with clients is not always an easy thing, impressing them is even harder. But there&#8217;s on thing that every (business) client loves and that&#8217;s almost anything visual (excuse the irony of my site lacking just that).

Doing a great Sitecore demo for clients means you need a few things, a little luck, a spoonful of low expectations, and a lot of preparation and experience. This applies to any type of client demo but let us talk about Sitecore specific for a moment and follow along.  
<!--more-->

  
**#1. Lower expectations**  
Sitecore is some what on the technical side in comparison to a platform such as WordPress, so chances are if you&#8217;re doing a demo for a client, it&#8217;s because you are the only Sitecore techie in the room. And lets face it, business people hate talking to developers for one reason or another but it probably has something to do with our general lack of care for their end goals and how we &#8220;inflate&#8221; timelines and care about things like scope creep and technical debt. Oh! And the fact that most of us can&#8217;t speak their &#8220;language&#8221; or just don&#8217;t want to.

So with the expectations already set in your favour, it&#8217;s actually quite easy to impress the business when you just do the next 2 things.

**#2. Prepare. And keep it together.**  
Seriously, when it comes to doing a demo please don&#8217;t &#8220;wing it&#8221;. And by wing it, I mean not having a clue what topics you&#8217;ll cover or how you&#8217;ll get there.

For example, if you&#8217;ve just completed some great new fixes and features for a client, you should demo them in logical sections/groups and overall the demo should be one cohesive transition from one topic to another. Don&#8217;t talk about your awesome Page Editor customization then mention Security Presets only to switch topics back to Designer components. Anything to do with the Page Editor should be grouped together, even security can be shown off using different logged in users to see alternate views and access to different functionality. This keeps both topics together, with the bonus of having your nice UI sink into the client&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex" title="Wiki Visual Cortex" target="_blank">visual cortex</a> (don&#8217;t know why I linked that, just thought it was a interesting read). Anyways, from the business user&#8217;s perspective, they don&#8217;t want to be glancing around from one screen to another trying desperately to follow along and hopelessly failing. Keeping your content nicely tied in to visual groups will work in you favour.

A nice grouping example if I&#8217;m required to demo: Page Editor, Desktop shortcuts, ASR module (reports) and Security changes.

  * Custom Page Editor buttons
  * User security (alternate functionality access)
  * Custom Experience Buttons (showing off the user&#8217;s access from above)
  * Components in Edit and Preview modes

Even though I may have Content Editor changes or security setting can also be viewed in the Core, you should keep the client on the same general UI as long as possible showing off as many features as possible. I would then group the ASR module with the Desktop shortcuts and to make it even sweeter, I&#8217;d make a Desktop shortcut FOR the ASR module.

One thing I didn&#8217;t mention&#8230;Do have your Page Editor or Content Tree, or whatever you&#8217;re demoing already prepped. That is, have separate pages created for each type of (grouped) components or features you&#8217;re showing off, a clean content tree with the items already created and selected on a separate browser tab just waiting to be clicked on. This not only helps you out from stumbling around making your clients wait and stare at nothing (or worse their phones) but it also makes you look, umm, prepared.

**#3. Never code**  
When it comes to coding, I&#8217;ve never been the &#8220;hacker&#8221; type who can whip together a working piece of software in seconds. But even if I was, I would still live by this rule. Coding during a demo is never a good idea. No one wants to see you type. No one! Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. From compilation errors to environment setup issues to the font being too small, there is just no upside to coding for a crowd of people not there to see you type. Remember we&#8217;re talking about a demo to the stakeholder/business groups. If you must show code in a demo, use snippets or a pre-typed class and just explain what each piece does. 

Don&#8217;t get embarrassed by build errors &#8211; &#8220;I swear it worked this morning&#8221; &#8211; HA!
