Only 5 reasons to *love and loathe* Sitecore may seem a bit extreme and it is. But in my first month of development I&#8217;ve learned some things about Sitecore. 1) It&#8217;s a great .NET CMS product and 2) I have reasons to love and loathe Sitecore. Here are my top 5&#8230;  
</br>

### #1. No famous 5 minute installation

Unlike WordPress, Sitecore has no fast and easy installation process. Just to get things up and running you need to have a technical background. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing on it&#8217;s own as Sitecore isn&#8217;t pitched to the small non-techie crowd like WordPress is (sometimes). That being said, there ain&#8217;t nothing wrong with a 5 minute installation process.

### #2. Sitecore is a framework

At least to me it is. And by that I mean Sitecore is not a &#8220;product&#8221; per se, as in you buy it, use it, you&#8217;re done. It&#8217;s a more of a framework which allows you to build your product (CMS / website) easier and faster in a .NET environment than most other software platforms out there.

### #3. Sitecore Desktop

Windows XP is a well known and loved OS but why, oh why, imitate it so closely??? The Sitecore Desktop is definitely an interesting concept and I can see the benefit of a new user seeing Sitecore for the first time and already knowing how to navigate the interface. But still. I loathe the Desktop. I love the Desktop.  
</br>

### #4. Sitecore Rocks

Sitecore Rocks is an amazing piece of software which I love and every developer should experience its greatness. It&#8217;s basically a way to move Content Editor, Template Manager and all the other functionality of Sitecore Desktop into Visual Studio. I loathe Sitecore Rocks because I can&#8217;t do everything with it, which means, I either stick to the Desktop and do it all in one place or I go back and forth between Rocks and the Desktop.  
</br>

### #5. Ctrl+Z

I don’t think I have yet heard an explanation good enough to validate why there is no undo function in Sitecore. Many a time, did I wish I could simply click a button to save me from myself. Whether it’s to rename an item to its original name or bring it back from oblivion, I loathe Sitecore for not having the Undo button.

## Love it or loathe

In every platform or software there&#8217;s the good, the bad and the ugly. In my (just over) month long journey I&#8217;ve only come across a handful of these in Sitecore. And that&#8217;s pretty damn great!

What do you love or loathe about Sitecore?
