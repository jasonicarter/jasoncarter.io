&#8220;WordsPlus for BlackBerry 10 is possibly the most fun, most charming and most connected word search game for BlackBerry&#8221;

&#8230;That was my elevator pitch, and honestly, looking for word search games on BlackBerry World today, I still stand by it. But all good things must come to a semi-end and here&#8217;s mine with BlackBerry, so as of today, WordsPlus is now available on <a title="WordsPlus" href="https://github.com/jasonicarter/wordsplus" target="_blank">Github</a>. However, you can still download the game for a couple more months on <a title="WordsPlus" href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/24752875" target="_blank">BlackBerry World</a>.

## Where it all started

Who can resist money, fame and glory, right? Well, although BlackBerry didn&#8217;t guarantee any of that, they did offer a new platform to tinker with and a potential $10k reward. So with that, I took up the challenge and created the first version of my app. WordsPlus was a launch title for BlackBerry 10 in early 2013. At the time of launch it was the only word search game on the platform, and for a long time afterwards one of the only games developed with BlackBerry&#8217;s new language QML / Qt markup. It won an award, got some recognition for BBM integration and made a few bucks (but not the $10k reward).

## All good things&#8230;

With BlackBerry moving away from consumers, particularly in the gaming department &#8211; literally asking for a flood of Android apps, getting a tie up with Amazon App Store and most recently killing off <a title="Scoreloop" href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/blackberry-to-shut-down-scoreloop-1405016393" target="_blank">Scoreloop</a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided to hang it up. WordsPlus was heavily integrated with a number of things that are no longer supported, and it&#8217;s pretty messy to get a dev environment up and running with the latest SDK, fix the old code and remove the killed off services. But hopefully, someone can make good use of the code and if not, maybe you&#8217;ll just be interested in how I did it.

## Code Disclaimer

Please don&#8217;t use this code as is in your project. It&#8217;s terribly out of date, which is one reason why I can&#8217;t even be bothered to update things. Also, excuse my design and possibly even that of my code. There&#8217;s a mixture of QML, Qt and C++ scattered around in there, all of which I learned for this project.
