It&#8217;s here! Sitecore 8 has finally <a title="Sitecore 8" href="https://www.sitecore.net/Platform/Sitecore-8.aspx" target="_blank">arrived</a>. And if you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re excited about what it has to offer since Sitecore 8 is packed full of fixes, improvements and new features but probably the biggest (and arguably the best) difference in Sitecore 8 compared to earlier iterations is its focus on marketing and analytics.

The digital marketing industry is HUGE! And Sitecore is adding to their A/B testing and Personalization (DMS features) with a whole set of new nifty things. And if you&#8217;re not yet onboard Sitecore 8 and digital marketing &#8211; do it now!

But with so many new things to tackle in Sitecore 8, it&#8217;s easy to be lost in not knowing where to start. And that&#8217;s where I come in, so have no fear, read up on my Top 8 Sitecore 8 Resources and keep coming back for updates:

So there you have it, my Top 8 Sitecore 8 Resources. Of course, this is only the 2014 version of the list and given that Sitecore 8 was only released last week (mid-December 2014), there aren&#8217;t many great resources available yet. But be on the look out for updates to my list and&#8230;

In the meantime, if you have a blog post you wrote or know of any good resources (for both the techie and non-technie crowd), please add a comment and let me know.
