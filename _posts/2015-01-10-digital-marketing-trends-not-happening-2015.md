Here comes the predictions&#8230;Everyone who&#8217;s anyone in the digital marketing world is putting out predictions on trends to expect in 2015. And although I definitely agree with some of those predictions &#8211; ** content continues to rule, video ads are more and better integrated everywhere and big data gets even bigger and smarter** &#8211; but I&#8217;ve also seen some down-right ridiculous ones.

I don&#8217;t have 30, 20 or even 10 years of dedicated marketing experience, as you&#8217;d know if you read my <a title="About Me" href="http://jasoncarter.io/about/" target="_blank">bio</a>, but when we talk about &#8220;digital&#8221; I know a thing or two about user experience, platforms, how to build them and how to analyze their data and that has to be worth something. So let&#8217;s get to it!

Here are my 2 big digital marketing trends **NOT** happening in 2015:

## Wearable Tech

With CES 2015 in the news this week, everyone is talking about wearables and how &#8220;it&#8217;s a game changer&#8221;. I do believe wearables will have a huge impact on consumer&#8217;s every day life and hence marketing will follow and expand/exploit this new category but not in 2015. Not to say I&#8217;m down playing wearables, I definitely want me an Apple Watch! But all of the hype around how huge it&#8217;ll be and all of the new marketing angles we can do on/with these devices in 2015 needs to stop. Once again, just take a look at these numbers and you do the math:

Fitbit has <a title="Fitbit 50 percent of the market" href="http://www.cnet.com/news/fitbit-rules-50-percent-of-the-worlds-wearable-market/" target="_blank">50% of the wearable market</a>, calculated at 2.7 million &#8220;wearable band&#8221; shipments in Q1 of 2014. That&#8217;s ONLY 2.7 million. Meanwhile, Apple sold over 10 million iPhone 6 devices&#8230;<a title="iPhone 6 hot streak" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/10/05/iphone-6-launch-continues-hot-streak/" target="_blank">over a 3 day period</a>.

2015 is the year wearable devices will be taken seriously, but it&#8217;s far from being the Year of the Wearable.

## Consumers Will Want More Privacy Online

This one comes up every year. This year it was <a title="Ello" href="https://ello.co" target="_blank">Ello</a> that made a splash. But so did <a title="Whisper" href="http://whisper.sh/" target="_blank">Whisper</a> and many others in pervious years as &#8220;some&#8221; people look for more privacy online. But please don&#8217;t mistake me for someone who thinks privacy is dead but every time Facebook changes their privacy policy a predictable outcome occurs 1) there&#8217;s a public/media outcry 2) followed by (of all things) a Facebook Page filled with angry users calling for an exodus of Facebook 3) an apology by a PR rep and lastly 4) the policy changes stay in place and FB continues to grow its user base.

But enough about Facebook, with new technology in terms of big data, wearable tech and the Internet of Things, expectations of privacy will be even greater but also will efficiencies, services, usefulness and connectivity.

  * Will the customer shy away from OnStar if it will help them reduce their car insurance rate?
  * What about turning off your iPhone location service so you can&#8217;t get that in-store coupon?

Do you really want your fridge knowing you&#8217;re a vegan? It calls home to GE passing on the word, who in turns sells that data, your data, to P&G, who then targets you through the real world with vegan products even though you&#8217;re not really vegan you just love Soy milk&#8230;

**Online Privacy is dead. Long live Online Privacy.**
