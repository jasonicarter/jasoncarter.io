Core or Master? Or is this the Web database? Switching databases on Sitecore Desktop can be a little tricky for the newbie. If you’ve read through all of the <a title="Sitecore sdn" href="https://sdn.sitecore.net" target="_blank">Sitecore sdn documentation</a> you would have stumbled upon this one at some point. But if like me, you jumped into Sitecore, skimmed (and that&#8217;s being generous) the docs and possibly missed that, &#8220;oh by the way&#8221;, moment from the trainer during your <a title="Sitecore Training and Certification Exam" href="http://jsoncarter.com/sitecore-training-and-certification-exam/" target="_blank">certification</a> course, then this little but useful tip will be a great addition to your tool kit.

When you log into Sitecore Desktop, by default, you&#8217;re pointing to the Master database but there&#8217;s no visible indication of this and no obvious button to allowing you to switch to Core or Web. But don&#8217;t sweat it! You can not only switch databases pretty easily but you can also turn on a visible indicator to let you know which db you&#8217;re looking at.

To figure this one out, just follow the steps below.

  * Log into Sitecore Desktop
  * In the bottom right hand corner you&#8217;ll see a database icon

  * Your next step is to left click on the database icon. You should now see below image on your screen

  * Here you can see I’m on the Master database
  * Now select Core and the desktop will close any open windows and switch over to the Core database. It&#8217;s that easy!

But even better yet, click on “Show Database Name” to always have the name, Master, Core or Web displayed on the sceen.

Make sure to always select the Master database after working with Core or Web, this will help reduce the risk of going straight from Web/Core Desktop to Page Editor and making changes. Been there, done that. Do not repeat.
