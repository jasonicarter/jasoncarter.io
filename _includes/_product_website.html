<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>JasonCarter.io is the home of my personal website, blog and brand. Recently, I've rebuilt my website converting it from a WordPress to Jekyll. I'm currently using a heavily modified Jekyll theme,<a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">minimal-mistakes</a>, as my base.</p>
<p>All custom UI/UX and front-end coding has been done by me where some snippets of open source code/jquery plugins have been modified and/or integrated into the website were required.</p>
